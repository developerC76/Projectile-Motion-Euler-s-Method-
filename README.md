# Projectile-Motion-Eulers-Method
Using default turtle graphics to create a trajectory of the graph of a projectile, which is calculated using the simple approximation method known as Euler's Method. 

The minimum delta time input for this simulation is 0.001 unless the roundong decimal place is changed.
