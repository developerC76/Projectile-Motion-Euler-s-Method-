## Projectile Motion Simulation using Euler's Method

### Before you test it out...
The minimum delta time input for this simulation is 0.001 unless the round() decimal place is changed. 

### Files

    main_matplotlib.py: 
        Matplotlib and NumPy are used to get a more in-depth graph of different aspects of the motion such as velocity and acceleration, along with the range, height, and obviously time. 

    main_turtle.py
        Using default turtle graphics to create a trajectory of the graph of a projectile.
